### RISC-V ISA Emulator

This is a project I have been working on for a graduate course in computer architecture. I am building a 32-bit RISC-V ISA emulator in C. This includes all integer, multiplication, and division instructions. This is implemented in several stages:
 - Virtual Machine Setup
 - Read ELF File
 - Fetch Cycle
 - Decoding Cycle
 - Execute Cycle
 - Memory Cycle
 - Writeback Cycle
